It is possible to generate the SNS-3 doxygen and sphinx documentation
without the need to have/compile the NS-3 source code.

To generate the doxygen documentation, launch:
`make doxygen`

To generate all sphinx documentation, launch:
`make SPHINXOPTS=-N -k html singlehtml latexpdf`

All generated documentation will be stored in a new folder named `doc`
